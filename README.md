step 6:execute the "final.py" source code in this current repository to see the output mentioned in the project documentation.
step 7:aurdino will monitor the surrounding air quality and gives output in the code of python.
step 8: To get the output, it may take more than 5 minutes.
step 9:or else we can try it in the html code for getting the output of aurdino and can display the output within 5 minutes
